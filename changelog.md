# Server Pack v2 Changelog

## v2.0.6

### Added:

#### Mods:

- Bad Wither No Cookie
- Simply Jetpacks
- Sound Mufflers (The OG version of Extreme Sound Mufflers)
- WiZoom

#### Other:

- Recipes to convert Greenery Grasses into Ferns and Tall Grass respectively
- Tooltips on all non-vanilla Shears indicating they won't work on Greenery Grasses ‚òπÔ∏è

### Changed:

- Colytra weren't respecting enchantments like they do in modern versions, so your attached elytra will now deduct durability from your chestplate (I don't believe it'll break the chestplate though)
- Telepads can now have their coordinates and dimensions changed directly within the UI (this was a server change I made a while ago, but now propagating it into the main client pack as well)

### Fixed:

- Botania Lexicon not working properly in the Akashic Tome
- /dank/nulls getting into weird broken states where they flicker constantly as if they're being punched once per tick
- Fixed any cases where Immersive Intelligence's Rubber Saplings were _required_ (they'll now take TechReborn's üôÇ)

## v2.0.5

### Added:

- Colytra
- Cosmetic Armor
- Enchantment Descriptions
- Extreme Reactors (with modified recipes & textures)

### Changed:

- Swapped out FoamFix + TexFix + VanillaFix for VintageFix again but with better configuration to avoid prior complaints
  - This was due to a recurring crash seen with Witchery Resurrected and villages, better safe than sorry
- Bibliocraft Bookcases can no longer store EBW books - apparently books stacking caused a small crash that would make stairs/rotatables always face North or South...
- EBW Bookshelves are much cheaper now, costing 6 Gilded Planks and the corresponding Bibliocraft Bookcase

## v2.0.4

### Changed:

- Devoritium Ore from Ancient Spellcraft, if it _was_ generating (I never saw any), is now being generated by CoFH World
  - The biggest change here is that if you end up needing any, you'll find it **_deep_** in the Magical Forest biomes
- Fixed EBW Crystal Ore generation
- Disabled Quark's Print Suppression feature
- Changed ClaimIt's chunk claiming item from a wrench to a stick

## v2.0.3

### Added:

- ClaimIt (a chunk claiming system)
  - Using a Wooden Wrench (the one from Chisels n Bits), you can claim an area that only you can build in. ClaimIt also has commands so you can add teammates.
- Culinary Construct
- FoamFix, VanillaFix, TexFix (all replacements for VintageFix, but less hacky)
- MrCrayFish's Furniture Mod (many recipes like dishwashing have been removed)

### Updated:

- FluidLogging API

### Changed:

- Reinstated Akashic Tome Recipe

### Fixed:

- Removed the duplicate Hunger & Saturation Tooltips on foods
- Added every single book class (I may have missed some, let me know if I did) to the Immersive Combat blacklist so that the Akashic Tome can work as expected again
- Electroblob's Wizardry's Crystal Ore not generating
-

### Removed:

- Roots Classic

  Repeated debugging and repros later and we've determined that it causes not only rampant memory leaks when wearing any of the mod's armors, but also incredibly poor FPS when another player is in rendering range & within the camera's frustum. TL;DR: player renderer borked

- VintageFix

  Caused significantly more issues than it resolved - you'll notice that startup times will be longer now, but you won't have severe lag spikes as you play and you'll see _significantly_ fewer broken textures. Also lets me get rid of LoliASM which is good because the fewer hacky mods, the better

## v2.0.2

### Installed:

- Bibliocraft
- Nether Portal Fix
- Metal Chests
- Nether Chest
- More Overlays

### Removed:

- TorchOptimizer (redundant with More Overlays)

## v2.0.1

### Removed:

- Recurrent Complex, IvToolkit & Antique Atlas Recurrent Complex Integration
  - RecComplex was causing _horrendous_ runnaway/cascading world gen

### Updated:

- Voidpack to include a few more textures
- Added Root's Old Root & Botania's Pasture Seed as drops for Greenery's Grasses
- Disabled recipe for Akashic Tome because of a conflict with Better Combat.
  - Next update I'll be removing this item so please remove all books from your tomes by selecting the book and pressing Shift (Sneak) + Q (Throw)

## v2.0.0

### Initialization!

Thanks to chat (namely PIPPIP, Foreck, jbredwards & more for guiding me through the latest & greatest in 1.12 üòÄ)
